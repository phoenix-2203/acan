/**
 * Browser bb.js loader.
 *
 * bb.js's `dest/browser/` is copied verbatim into `public/vendor/bb/` by
 * scripts/vendor-bb.mjs (run via the app's predev/prebuild). We load it as a
 * NATIVE ES module from that stable path instead of letting webpack bundle it,
 * because bb.js resolves its wasm Web Worker relative to `import.meta.url`
 * (`new Worker(new URL('./main.worker.js', import.meta.url))`, marked
 * `webpackIgnore`). Bundling moves `index.js` into a hashed `_next` chunk whose
 * sibling `main.worker.js` doesn't exist, so the worker never loads and proving
 * hangs. Served from `/vendor/bb/index.js`, `import.meta.url` points at a real
 * directory where the worker + wasm files are present.
 *
 * `nativeImport` is built with `new Function` so webpack never sees an
 * `import()` to analyze/rewrite (and so no magic-comment survives SWC concerns).
 * It is constructed lazily inside the loader callback: `new Function` is
 * forbidden on Cloudflare Workers (EvalError: code generation from strings),
 * and this module gets pulled into the SSR bundle even though proving is
 * browser-only.
